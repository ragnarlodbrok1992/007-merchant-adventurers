# Merchant Adventurers - Game Design Document

## Overview

## Game Concepts

### Main ideas

Going with three main ideas to start with.
I'll elaborate on them later in Gameplay Mechanics
section.

1. Exploration and Discovery - world will be procedurally generated.
   Not visible for player at the start, but can be explored when needed.
2. Merchant Empire Building - focusing on trade we explore and make our
   trading empire bigger and better.
3. Trade Wars in Dynamic Economy with a hint of naval/land warfare - main
   focus of the game will be on dynamic economy. Naval/land warfare should
   only be fought to secure some more trade or to cripple rivalries.

## Gameplay Mechanics

1. Hex based 3D world.
2. Main units - ships.
3. Bodies of water to use for player. There can be inland convoying, but to a lower extend than
   trading by water. Different way of playing on small islands vs big continents.
