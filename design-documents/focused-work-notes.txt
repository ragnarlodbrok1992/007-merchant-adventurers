1. What is focused work?

It is something that I have to implement to just push myself through stuff and create whatever I want.
Focused work consists of:
  - time frame where I am focused
  - no distractions
  - no multitasking
  - what I am going to work on as clear as possible

And it's goal is to:
  - get things done
  - improve my skills
  - create something
  - spend the time actually doing work

What is done after finishing a time iteration for focused work:
  - what was done
  - how was it done
  - what can be improved
  - what will be done next

2. Focused work tasks/normal tasks:
